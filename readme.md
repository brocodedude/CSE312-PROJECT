NOTE:

Timing feature does not work on live deployment,
must be tested locally

## Custom feature

Animations: We added animations
to the game which allows players to see animations when a character moves.

Testing procedure:

1. Open first browser connect to a game.

2. Open second browser connect to the same game as first browser.

3. Move character in first browser, 
make sure that the character in the other browser has the same animation as the character you are controlling.

4. Move character in second browser, 
make sure that the character in the other browser has the same animation as the character you are controlling.
