### Directory structure

```

| Project
| -> src -> core application logic here (eg. database, auth etc). accessible only using the /api/* path
      |
      | -> routes -> define different routers here

| -> public -> frontend stuff with each directory as its own page
               e.g login dir will contain css,html,js for login page 
```
